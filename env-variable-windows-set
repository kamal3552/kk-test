import os
import getpass

# Ask user for password
password = getpass.getpass(prompt='Enter password: ')

# Set password as Windows environment variable
os.environ['MY_PASSWORD'] = password

# Later, retrieve password from environment variable
password = os.environ.get('MY_PASSWORD')

# Use password in your code as needed
print(f'My password is: {password}')
In this example, the getpass.getpass() function is used to prompt the user to enter a password without displaying the input on the screen. The password entered by the user is stored in the password variable.

The os.environ dictionary is used to set the password as a Windows environment variable with the name MY_PASSWORD.

Later in the code, the os.environ.get() function is used to retrieve the password from the environment variable, and it is stored in the password variable again.

You can then use the password variable in your code as needed. In this example, it is simply printed to the console using an f-string. Note that you should be careful when storing passwords as environment variables, and ensure that they are kept secure and not accidentally exposed.
=====================================

import os

# Define the name of the environment variable to check
var_name = 'MY_VARIABLE'

# Check if the environment variable exists
if var_name in os.environ:
    print(f'The {var_name} environment variable exists.')
else:
    print(f'The {var_name} environment variable does not exist.')
